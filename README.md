# Experimental-Guide-of-Deployment-friendly-Link-Adaptation-Based-on-On-line-Reinforcement-Learning

This article gives a description of the complete process of deploying the four algorithms and experimental validation mentioned in the article, Deployment-friendly Link Adaptation Based on On-line Reinforcement Learning, and instructions for using the source code. A complete log of the experimental data from the paper and the training model for reinforcement learning is provided in the attached file.

For details, please read the Experimental_description_of_Q_L_AOLLA.pdf. For developers who want to verify the algorithms in the paper, we strongly recommend to read carefully Section V, Experimental Validation on an SDR-based Hardware Platform, of the Experimental_description_of_Q_L_AOLLA.pdf.
